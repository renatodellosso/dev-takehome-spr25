        I once spent a week sharing a cabin with a six-foot snake! "Cabin" might
        be a strong word - it was more a three-walled shack in the woods. It
        happened at Boy Scout camp; we showed up on Sunday, walked over to our
        "cabin," and - something moved! After much kerfuffle, we found the snake
        slithering around the cabin. This new cabinmate was concerning, until an
        older scout clarified that it was Casper, who'd lived there for years.
        We left the snake alone and it returned the favor, though it did slither
        behind my friend while he was reading. We think Casper's children have
        spread to the other cabins.
